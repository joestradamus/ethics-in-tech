<h1 style="color: white" class="fragment"> How to Reach the Star Trek Singularity </h1>

Note:

This is a phrase coined by Cathy O'Neil, a prominent data scientist now evangelizing the harms of big data. She explains,

> Itâ€™s the moment where we decide that human dignity is of paramount importance, and we learn how to use technology to enhance human experience

## Key Questions

* What is technology, and why should we be worried about its current landscape? |
* How should we address these challenges in technology? |
* How do these issues affect Slalom's business and clientele? |
* How should we respond? |

## The Current Landscape 

* The Value of Attention |
* Attitudes on Data |
* Consent in the Digital Age |
* Diversity |
* Responsibility |

Note:

1. What's happening to our attention, and what does it mean?
2. How do we think of data collection? As developers, and as consumers?
3. The complexity of technology complicates and challenges our view of informed consent
4. I want to materialize the *specific* harms of the lack of diversity in tech: machine learning, ui/ux design, feature development, and edge cases
5. What is our responsibility? As developers, designers, decision makers, and users of technology?

This is a broad outline of the core topics I want to discuss. I won't talk about these linearly, just giving you a preview

# Why We Should Care

+++ 

## We Lose Business

* For 26% of online households, security and privacy concerns stopped them from buying goods or services. |
* For 29% of online households, security and privacy concerns stopped them from conducting financial transactions |

-- [2015 survey of 41,000 households by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration](https://www.ntia.doc.gov/blog/2016/lack-trust-internet-privacy-and-security-may-deter-economic-and-other-online-activities) |

## Misconduct is Costly

> For each dollar that a firm misleadingly inflates its market value, on average, it loses this dollar when its misconduct is revealed, plus an additional $3.08. Of this additional loss, $0.36 is due to expected legal penalties and $2.71 is due to lost reputation. In firms that survive the enforcement process, lost reputation is even greater at $3.83.

## Ethics Begets Productivity

## Ethics Attracts Talent

> A survey of more than 800 MBAs from 11 leading North American and European schools found 94%  were willing to forgo up to 20% of their income to work for an organization with a better reputation for corporate social responsibility and ethics

# Responsibility

+++

* As developers |
* As designers |
* As decision makers |
* As stakeholders |

+++

> When a designer lets a bad business decision through, *that's* a decision as well

> This is how bad design makes it out into the world: not due to malicious intent, but with no intent at all

# What Should Be Done?

* Social |
* Legal |
* Cultural |

+++

## Social 

+++?image=images/shame.gif&size=auto 80%

<a href="https://darkpatterns.org/hall-of-shame" target="_blank" class="fragment">Examples</a>

Note:
* Public shaming is an option, but not really a solution; just look at how dishes get handled in our kitchens
* Despite this, it's important, as it motivates companies to avoid negative PR under public pressure

+++

## Legal

+++

E.U. Privacy laws vs. U.S.
Compliance/certification?
Regulations
Consistent, single source of truth for best practices

+++

> Morality cannot be legislated, but behavior can be regulated.

-- Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., UCLA, 1965

## Cultural
